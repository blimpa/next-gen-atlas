          <td>The distinction between the "letter of the rule" and the "spirit of the rule" refers to whether an
            individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also
            considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the
            underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a
            given context.A "letter of the rule" interpretation adheres strictly to the rule's language, often
            exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule's
            exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if
            it benefits the interpreter.A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's
            true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of
            the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to
            a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent
            outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.Example:Imagine a
            large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that
            allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a
            greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.By exploiting the "letter of the
            rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment
            and public health in practice.A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious
            competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose -
            protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts
            the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the
            harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally
            aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the
            loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended
            purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</td>

            choice of limitations on liquidations for any or all of the vault types in the Sky Protocol.• Level
            0 - Liquidations Enabled - The breaker is not tripped, new vaults can be liquidated and old
            liquidations can proceed.• Level 1 - New Liquidations Disabled - No new liquidations can take
            place.• Level 2 - New Liquidations and Resets Disabled - No new liquidations can take place. No
            existing auctions can be reset if they expire.• Level 3 - All Liquidations Disabled - No new
            liquidations, no resets, no bidding in active auctions.This functionality is exceptional because
            liquidations at non-market prices have the potential to be irreversibly damaging to both users and
            the Sky Protocol. The circuit breaker allows Sky Governance to attempt to limit the damage in the
            event of an issue affecting liquidations without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay.Additionally, the
            contract allows for permissionless activation of the circuit breaker, if the price decrease in a
            collateral exceeds a preset percentage value between oracle price updates. The permissionless
            activation triggers the circuit breaker at Level 2 because both new auctions and resets reference
            the current oracle price.When Level (0, 1, 2, 3) of liquidations circuit breaker is altered via
            Executive Vote, Sky Governance has the ability to set locked time, which is a specified duration
            which needs to pass before the liquidations circuit breaker can be triggered again via
            permissionless activation.The risk opened up by this exceptional functionality is that liquidations
            may be halted by an attacker in order to either:• Prevent an expensive liquidation.• Take advantage

            Other amended components that do not have edits in simultaneous proposals may be merged, unless they
            are dependent on the component that does have simultaneous edits.Where simultaneous edits are

            edit either by stitching them together in the affected component or by stringing one after the other

            they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Proposals, a subsequent binary

          <td>Spark Protocol must pay out 10% of the income it generates from operating the borrowing and lending
            functionality of the protocol that is based on the Aave codebase. The payment must be calculated
            manually at the end of each quarter by the Spark Star Facilitators and manually paid as Dai to a
            smart contract under the control of Aave Governance from the Spark Star Surplus Buffer. The payments
            must occur for the revenue share duration of two (2) years, starting from the moment this amendment
            is approved by Sky Governance. If at any point in time after the launch of Star tokens, Spark
            Protocol is generating less than 1 million Dai per year in income for Spark Star, accrual towards
            the revenue share payments are paused (unpaid revenue share that already accrued is still paid out
            at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The
            revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when
            Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.Before the launch of
            Star tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on
            behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark
            Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a
            revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the
            Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Star
            tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million
            Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai.
            This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance
            from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the
            launch of Star tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky
            Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue
            share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of
            the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of
            the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from
            Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol.Once Star tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be
            discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement
            shall take effect.</td>

            Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an
            offboarding of that collateral or vault type. There have been several instances where users entered
            official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically
            comfortable collateralization ratios (<a
              href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836</a>).
            This is, understandably, a poor user experience. Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the
            forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially
            taxable events. This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about
            upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of
            users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

            Rate or Token Reward balances, the Integrator earns a Marketing Fee of 0.4% of the balance per
            year.For Unrewarded USDS balances, the Integrator earns a Marketing Fee of [Savings Rate - 0.2%] of
            the balance per year.<strong>Onchain and Offchain Accessibility Reward Code Marking</strong>The
            Accessibility Reward Codes can be marked to a balance both through onchain and offchain processes.•
            Onchain means they are directly included in the users' transactions so they can be read on-chain,
            through a special signature on the token transfer method.• Offchain means that various, continuously
            updated offchain monitoring mechanisms can be used to prove that an Integrator's Accessibility
            Reward Code is connected to particular accounts and balances, such as their user balances or

              Reward Code Assignment Process</strong>On an interim basis, Phoenix Labs and Viridian Advisors

            category). In these threads, they must maintain a list of the Integrators who have received
            Accessibility Reward Codes, including the specific code itself, and the Integrators' Ethereum
            addresses to which the Accessibility Rewards are to be paid.Phoenix Labs and Viridian Advisors can
            maintain a separate Forum thread, or use other means, to enable prospective Integrators to sign up
            for their Accessibility Reward Codes.<strong>Accessibility Reward Payment</strong>Where feasible,
            Phoenix Labs and Viridian Advisors must calculate on a monthly basis the onchain and offchain
            Accessibility Rewards earned for the Codes they are responsible for. If there are calculations that
            cannot reasonably be done, they can be delayed and later calculated.Every month, the Accessibility
            Facilitators must ensure that the calculated Accessibility Rewards are paid out to the corresponding

            far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be
            necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination
            of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be
            tailor-made.Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in
            governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of
            governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other

            the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be
            Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from

            The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act
            that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach
            if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply
            subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.Despite the lack of explicit
            guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in <dfn>A.1.4</dfn> to reach a
            reliable adjudication principle. Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires
            Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk.
            The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an
            opportunity for corrective action and learning. After the initial warning, any subsequent breach
            must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial
            breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a
            necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal
            Alignment.

            demonstrate a 51% or greater chance that the AC committed a misaligned act, the Facilitator is

            misalignment, Facilitators must prioritize an approach grounded in an abundance of caution, steering

          <td>Entity was an Aligned Delegate. Entity then secured a second role with an Ecosystem Actor providing
            Executive spell crafting services, specifically as an "on call" dev. Entity claims it has never been
            on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus,
            Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its
            investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that
            "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had
            been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the

            In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was
            not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the
            large compensation amount. That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a
            strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof
            of this. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC
            role would suffice, per <dfn>A.1.4
              - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition</dfn>.The
            concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if
            other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the
            Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice,
            which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

            instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to

            conflict?What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects
            minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP
            should take precedence?If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the
            former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the
            second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?If merging proposals
            in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance
            paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and
            counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the

            increases the complexity of governance operations.If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two
            approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the
            original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.</td>

            encourages having several part-time jobs. The sharing of contributors across several Sky teams -
            such that contributors gain experience in multiple operational aspects - might arguably enhance
            ecosystem intelligence. Would it make a meaningful difference to require contributors who do wish to

            This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the
            Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the
            foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding,
            evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals
            process, etc. The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is
            some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver
            misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing,
            such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. Needed Research here includes methods
            for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and
            comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What
            types of evidence are permissible to consider? See <dfn>Responsibly
              Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically</dfn>. What are the
            processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared
            with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? Then there is the matter of
            assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas
            and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate
            evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the
            credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the
            specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the
            application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a
            reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. How much discretion should Facilitators have in
            interpreting and applying the element "the highest standard of Universal Alignment"? How to
            safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate
            mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and
            evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels
            (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs),
            the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in
            decision-making.
